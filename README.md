# This is my personal config
It's getting pretty big, so I did some organizing on it, and made it a bit neater to look at.

Remember to call:
```elisp
(rtags-install)
(irony-install-server)
(jedi:install-server)
```

## TODO:
1. Fix flycheck-clang-analyzer
2. Tinker with helm menus to support EVIL better (probably some evil-collection stuff)
