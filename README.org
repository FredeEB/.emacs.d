It's getting pretty big, so I did some organizing on it, and made it a
bit neater to look at.

Remember to call:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (rtags-install)
    (irony-install-server)
    (jedi:install-server)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** TODO:

   :END:

1. Fix flycheck-clang-analyzer
2. Tinker with helm menus to support EVIL better (probably some
   evil-collection stuff)
